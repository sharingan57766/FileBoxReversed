## About
This project aims to reverse the database used by "Wor FileBox". This @Worcome-Studios program is dedicated to protect files.

## Legal Troubles
we know that the [license](http://worcomestudios.comule.com/WSS_Structure/AppHelper/AboutApps/WorFileBox.html) for the user is clearly stated 
```sh
3. Reverse engineering, decompilation and disassembly
You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE.
  ```
But who can resist when the morbidity of a programmer calls?
